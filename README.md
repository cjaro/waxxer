# Waxxer

As a cross country skier, it can be frustrating and confusing to prepare your skis for snow conditions: temperature, humidity, forecast, snowfall and more all factor into what kind of ski wax you'll need to put on the base of your skis. So what's a skier to do? All the big wax companies have their own charts and calculators, of course, but many of those are international and the estimates for local conditions can be unpredicatable at best and inaccurate at worst.

Say hello to Waxxer! While talking with my partner and ski buddy this winter, I had the idea to create a wax-where-you-are type application to give the best, most accurate weather conditions using a weather forecasting API. I developed this over the course of a few months, building out features and discussing the process with my partner, who is more knowledgeable about ski wax needs than I am, so during those discussions and rounds of feedback, this little input-output calculator became more than just that! I work on this one constantly and am looking forward to where I can take it next.

As of 2022, Waxxer has entered construction mode and I'm working on updating it to use OpenWeatherMap, as well as modernizing the entire application as well. There are lots of ideas floating around my head, so Waxxer has plenty of growing to do.
