# Waxxer

As a Nordic (cross country) skier, it can be frustrating and confusing to prepare your skis for snow conditions. Temperature, humidity, forecast - all these factors and more play into what kind of ski wax you'll need to put on the base of your skis. So what's a skier to do? All the big wax companies have their own charts and calculators, of course, but many of those are international and the estimates for local conditions can be shoddy at best.

Say hello to Waxxer! While talking with my partner and ski buddy this winter, I had the idea to create a wax-where-you-are type application to give the best, most accurate weather conditions using AerisWeather's powerful and accessible API. I developed this over the course of a few months, building out features and discussing the process with my partner, who is more knowledgeable about ski wax needs than I am, so during those discussions and rounds of feedback, this little input-output calculator became more than just that! I work on this one constantly and am looking forward to where I can take it next.
