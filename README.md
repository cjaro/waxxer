# Waxxer

As a cross country skier, it can be frustrating and confusing to prepare your skis for snow conditions: temperature, humidity, forecast, snowfall and more all factor into what kind of ski wax you'll need to put on the base of your skis. So what's a skier to do? [All](https://www.swixsport.com/en/ski-wax/) [the](https://tokous.com/) [big](https://brikomaplus.de/en/skiwachs/experts-order/) [wax](http://startskiwax.com/en/waxing-info) [companies](https://www.zumwax.com/) have their own charts and calculators, but the most accurate estimates for local conditions can be variable and relies on local ski shop information, historical race wax data & conditions, and experience waxing for the conditions over time.

Say hello to Waxxer! While talking with my partner/ski buddy this winter, I had the idea to create a wax-where-you-are type application to give the best, most accurate weather conditions for XC ski races using a weather (current conditions & forecasting) API.

As of 2022, Waxxer has entered construction model; there are lots of ideas floating around my head, so Waxxer has plenty of growing to do.
