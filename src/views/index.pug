      p Waxxer is a helpful calculator for the cross-country skier trying to pick the right ski wax while
        | considering variables like temperature, humidity, and snow type.
      p This project is a work-in-progress, so for now, you'll be able to query the weather by location and
        | see current conditions there, as well as the forecast for a few days in advance; generally speaking, this is
        | enough information to get a high-level conclusion on how to prep your skis, but future iterations
        | of this project will hopefully include historical data on both weather and ski races like the Birkie,
        | Vasaloppet USA, and more!
