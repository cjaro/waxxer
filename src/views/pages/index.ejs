            This project is a work-in-progress; for now, you'll be able to query the weather by location and see
            current conditions there, as well as the forecast for a few days in advance. Generally speaking, this is
            enough information to get a high-level conclusion on how to prep your skis, but future iterations of this
            project will hopefully include historical data on both weather and ski races like the American Birkebeiner,
            Vasaloppet USA, and more!
