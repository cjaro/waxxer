    This is a minimalist HTML and JavaScript skeleton of the GoJS Sample
    <a href="https://gojs.net/latest/samples/decisionTree.html">decisionTree.html</a>. It was automatically generated from a button on the sample page,
    and does not contain the full HTML. It is intended as a starting point to adapt for your own usage.
    For many samples, you may need to inspect the

    and copy other files or scripts.

  This sample allows a user to make progressive decisions about personality types.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are two kinds of nodes, so there are two node templates ("decision" and "personality")
  that determine the appearance and behavior of each <a href="../api/symbols/Node.html" target="api">Node</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  The "decision" template displays the abbreviated personality type and two choice buttons, all surrounded by a figure.
  Clicking a button will either expand the choice or will collapse all nodes leading from that choice.
  </p>
  <p>
  The "personality" template displays the personality descriptions, as the "leaf" nodes for the tree.
